The Currency Exchange System is a web application built using Node.js, Express, SQLite, and Tailwind CSS to provide users with an easy-to-use platform for currency conversions. The system dynamically fetches live exchange rates from an external API and allows users to convert between multiple global currencies. It also keeps a record of recent transactions for reference.

Transaction History:
Tracks recent conversions and displays them for the user.
Modern Frontend Design:
Built with HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Database-Driven Backend:
Utilizes SQLite for storing and querying exchange rates and transaction records.
